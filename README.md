# Mobile-Architecture-Sandbox

An experimental playground showcasing practical implementations of modern mobile architecture patterns and practices.

## About This Repository

This sandbox serves as a practical reference for mobile developers looking to implement robust architectural patterns in their applications. Rather than focusing on theory alone, the examples demonstrate how different architectural approaches solve real-world development challenges through actual code.

## Goals

- Experiment with practical implementations of modern mobile architecture patterns
- Showcase separation of concerns in action through clean, readable code
- Illustrate how proper architecture enables testability and maintainability
- Provide reference implementations for common mobile development challenges

## What's Inside

This sandbox will grow to include implementations of:

- **Clean Architecture** with proper layer separation
- **Presentation Patterns** (MVVM, MVI, MVP) with practical comparisons
- **Offline-First** data synchronization approaches
- **Modular Design** for scalable applications
- **Event-Driven Architecture** for responsive apps
- **Domain-Driven Design** principles applied to mobile
- **Testing Strategies** across different architecture layers

## Planned Examples

The sandbox will expand to include experiments addressing:

- User authentication flows with clean architecture
- Remote data integration with proper abstractions
- Local persistence and synchronization
- Navigation patterns with proper separation
- Dependency injection implementation
- Reactive programming patterns
- Testing strategies at all levels

## Technical Focus

While the repository will contain concrete implementations, the focus is on architecture rather than specific frameworks or libraries. The patterns demonstrated here can be applied across platforms and technologies.

## Status

This sandbox is currently in early development. Initial examples and implementations will be added soon. Check back for updates or watch the repository to be notified of new additions.
